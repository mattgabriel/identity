### Goal

Identity’s main goal is to build a standard format for the storage of a person’s data (both centralised and descentralised at the same time), as well as a set of rules to access it and manipulate it while giving the owner full control over it. In addition to this, the data should be stored on a medium of a person’s choosing (offline, online, private server, S3, etc.).

Read the [Whitepaper](https://github.com/mattgabriel/identity/blob/master/whitepaper/Whitepaper.pdf "Identity 's Whitepaper") for mode details.
